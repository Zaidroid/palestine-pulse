During the clashes, Palestinians threw stones and improvised explosive devices at the Israeli forces and fired at them. The military claimed explosive devices were thrown from his location, but B\u2019Tselem\u2019s research revealed a Palestinian threw an explosive device 50 meters away from where he and others were standing, and then fled to a forest about 250 meters away. Border Police officers delayed the ambulances that came to evacuate the wounded for about an hour. Five more Palestinians, including another minor, were killed, and seven others were injured by the Israeli forces' fire."
