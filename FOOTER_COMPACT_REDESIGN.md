# Footer Compact Redesign Complete âœ¨

The footer has been redesigned to be much more compact while showing all essential information in a well-organized two-line layout.

## Key Changes

### Layout Structure
- **Two-line design** for better space utilization
- **Top line**: Data sources with badges
- **Bottom line**: Update info and footer links
- Proper use of separators for visual organization

### Data Sources
- Added **B'Tselem** (Israeli human rights organization)
- Added **PCBS** (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics)
- Now showing **7 data sources** total:
  1. Tech4Palestine (GitHub Actions, every 6 hours)
  2. Good Shepherd (GitHub Actions, every 6 hours)
  3. UN OCHA (GitHub Actions, every 6 hours)
  4. B'Tselem (Scheduled Web Scraping, daily)
  5. PCBS (Scheduled Web Scraping, weekly)
  6. WFP (GitHub Actions, daily)
  7. World Bank (API Integration, monthly)

### Hover Cards - Fixed & Enhanced
- **Fixed positioning**: Now properly aligned with `align="start"` and `sideOffset={5}`
- **Better information**:
  - Source name and status
  - Detailed description of what each source provides
  - Update method (GitHub Actions, Web Scraping, or API)
  - Update frequency
  - Last sync time
  - Data quality badge (when available)
  - Status messages (when available)

### Update Information
- Shows when data was last updated
- Calculates next GitHub Actions run (every 6 hours)
- "Refresh Now" button for manual updates
- All times use relative formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago")

### Visual Improvements
- **Source badges** with status indicators (colored dots)
- Hover effects on badges (background change, border highlight)
- Syncing sources show pulse animation
- Better typography with proper font weights
- Consistent spacing and alignment

### Responsive Design
- Badges wrap naturally on smaller screens
- Two-line layout adapts to mobile
- All elements remain accessible and readable

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/ui/enhanced-footer.tsx` - Main footer component
2. `src/components/v3/layout/V3Footer.tsx` - V3 layout footer
3. `src/store/v3Store.ts` - Added B'Tselem and PCBS to initial sources
4. `src/components/v3/layout/RootLayout.tsx` - Removed unused props

### Data Source Info
Each source now includes:
```typescript
{
  description: string;      // What the source provides
  updateMethod: string;      // How it's updated
  updateFrequency: string;   // How often it updates
}
```

### GitHub Actions Schedule
- Runs every 6 hours (cron: `0 */6 * * *`)
- Fetches from Tech4Palestine, Good Shepherd, UN OCHA, WFP
- B'Tselem and PCBS use separate web scraping schedules

## Result

A clean, compact footer that:
- Takes up minimal vertical space (2 lines)
- Shows all 7 data sources clearly
- Provides detailed information on hover
- Indicates update methods (GitHub Actions vs Web Scraping)
- Shows accurate timing for next updates
- Maintains professional appearance
- Works perfectly on all screen sizes
