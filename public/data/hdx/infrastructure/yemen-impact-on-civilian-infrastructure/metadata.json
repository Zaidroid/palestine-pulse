CIMP is a service under the United Nations Protection Cluster for Yemen and, since going live on 01 August 2018, has reported in real-time on the impact of incidents of armed violence on civilians at the national level, divided into 5 hubs: Al-Hudaydah, Sa’ada, Sana’a, Aden and Ibb. The dataset shows the number of incidents to have impacted upon civilian houses, farms, vehicles, businesses and markets and the number of incidents to have impacted upon civilian infrastructure sites since December 2017.",
