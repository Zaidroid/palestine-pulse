At least 70 health workers were arrested and 95 health workers, as well as their family members, patients, and patient companions, were moved to another building in the compound without food and water. The southern wall of the medical facility was demolished and two ambulances destroyed. The next day, Israeli forces again moved male patients and their companions to the maternity building. Between 18-20 February, WHO evacuated around 43 patients in critical condition with the support of Red Cross and UN. As of 20 February, the ICU was no longer functioning and the remaining ICU patient was transferred to a different part of the complex. 110 patients and around 15 doctors and nurses remained at the medical facility. On 22 February, IDF withdrew from the medical facility, although the siege continued, severely restricting movement to and from the complex. On 27 February, 120 patients required medical evacuation from the now non-functional medical facility. On 12 March, two doctors who had been released reported that they had been tortured. On 5th and 8th April, two more doctors were released. On 22 September, it was reported that there was no trace of the gastroenterology specialist who had been detained in any IDF prison, detention centre or camp, and he was recorded as killed.",

The surgery building with medical staff, patients and displaced individuals trapped inside was hit with explosives and Israeli army vehicles and tanks were stationed inside the medical facilityâ€™s courtyard. Those seen moving inside the building were shot at. People inside the medical facility and surrounding areas were ordered to evacuate. Israeli soldiers claimed an exchange of fire with Hamas fighters inside the medical facility. As of 25th March, IDF claimed that 170 armed Palestinians killed and some 500 suspects were detained. An image published on 15th May showed that some of the detained were doctors and two head of departments. The IDF withdrew in the early hours of April 1st. The buildings of the medical facility were extensively damaged and the medical facility is no longer operable. All medical equipment was destroyed. On 01 September, the emergency department was officially reopened. A physician who had been detained during the raid died in an Israeli prison on 18th September.",
