  ```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Recent Files (90-Day Window)
- Changed from 30-day to 90-day window for recent.json files
- Provides better coverage for recent data analysis
- Applied to all time-series datasets (healthcare, demolitions, prisoners)

### 2. NGO Data Restructuring
- Split single `data.json` into structured files:
  - `organizations.json` - Individual organization records
  - `funding-by-year.json` - Yearly aggregated financial data
  - `index.json` - Summary and file listing
- Enables more efficient data loading and analysis

### 3. Enhanced Metadata
- Added detailed dataset information:
  - Record counts and date ranges
  - Partition counts and strategies
  - File listings for non-partitioned datasets
- Added summary statistics:
  - Total datasets: 6
  - Total records: 4,302
  - Total partitions: 31

### 4. Data Transformation
All datasets follow standardized format:
- Consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Standardized field names
- Source attribution
- Metadata headers on all files
