# Data Collection Expansion Requirements

## Introduction

The Palestine Pulse dashboard has successfully integrated local-first data loading for Tech4Palestine and Good Shepherd prisoner data (Phase 1-2 complete). However, the data infrastructure is incomplete: only a fraction of available datasets from HDX, Good Shepherd, and World Bank have been downloaded locally. This limits the dashboard's ability to provide comprehensive humanitarian analysis and forces unnecessary API dependencies. This feature will systematically expand the local data collection to include 30-40 additional HDX datasets, complete Good Shepherd data categories, and expand World Bank economic indicators.

## Glossary

- **Data_Collection_System**: The automated scripts and infrastructure that download and store data locally
- **HDX_Catalog**: The Humanitarian Data Exchange catalog containing 133+ Palestine-related datasets
- **Good_Shepherd_API**: The Good Shepherd Collective API providing healthcare, NGO, and demolition data
- **World_Bank_API**: The World Bank API providing economic and development indicators for Palestine
- **Local_Data_Store**: The `/public/data/` directory structure containing downloaded datasets
- **Data_Partitioning**: The process of splitting large datasets into time-based chunks (quarters, years)
- **Manifest_System**: The JSON catalog system that indexes all available local datasets
- **Fetch_Script**: Node.js scripts that download data from APIs and save locally

## Requirements

6. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL update the World Bank all-indicators.json catalog

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced fetch scripts with proper error handling and data validation, so that data collection is reliable and produces high-quality datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Fetch_Script SHALL validate data structure and format before saving locally
2. THE Fetch_Script SHALL handle API rate limits with exponential backoff
3. THE Fetch_Script SHALL retry failed downloads with configurable retry limits
4. THE Fetch_Script SHALL log all download operations with success and failure details
5. THE Fetch_Script SHALL validate downloaded data against expected schemas
6. THE Fetch_Script SHALL report data quality issues without failing the entire process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data partitioning for large datasets, so that the dashboard can efficiently load only the data it needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL partition datasets larger than 1000 records by quarter
2. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL create year-based partitions for multi-year datasets
3. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL generate recent.json files containing the most recent 90 days of data
4. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL create index files listing all available partitions
5. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL maintain consistent partition naming across all data sources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive data transformation for each dataset type, so that all local data follows consistent formats and is ready for dashboard consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL transform HDX datasets into standardized JSON format
2. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL normalize date formats across all datasets
3. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL standardize geographic identifiers across datasets
4. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL add metadata fields to all transformed datasets
5. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL validate transformed data against dashboard requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated manifest files that catalog all available local datasets, so that the dashboard can discover and load data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Manifest_System SHALL generate a complete catalog of all HDX datasets
2. THE Manifest_System SHALL generate a complete catalog of all Good Shepherd datasets
3. THE Manifest_System SHALL generate a complete catalog of all World Bank datasets
4. THE Manifest_System SHALL include metadata for each dataset including size, date range, and update frequency
5. THE Manifest_System SHALL provide partition information for all partitioned datasets

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive data validation after collection, so that I can verify all downloaded data is complete and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL validate that all expected datasets were downloaded successfully
2. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL verify data completeness by checking record counts
3. THE Data_Collection_System SHALL validate data quality by checking for missing required fields
