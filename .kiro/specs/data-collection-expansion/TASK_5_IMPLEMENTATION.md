# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Data Validation and Quality Checks

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive data validation and quality checking system for all data sources (HDX, Good Shepherd, World Bank). The system validates data structure, completeness, and quality, generates detailed reports, and integrates seamlessly with existing fetch scripts.

## Implementation Details

### 5.1 Data Validation Utility Functions ✅

**File Created:** `scripts/utils/data-validator.js`

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive validation schemas for 8 dataset types:
  - Casualties
  - Demolitions
  - Healthcare attacks
  - NGO organizations
  - World Bank indicators
  - Conflict events
  - Infrastructure damage
  - Humanitarian needs
  - Generic (fallback)

**Core Functions:**
1. `validateDataStructure(data, schema)` - Validates data against expected schemas
2. `validateDataCompleteness(data, requiredFields)` - Checks for required fields
3. `validateDataQuality(data, schema)` - Calculates quality scores
4. `validateDataset(data, datasetType)` - Main validation function with automatic schema detection
5. `getSchemaForDatasetType(datasetType)` - Schema lookup and matching

**Validation Features:**
- Required field validation
- Field type checking (string, number, boolean, array, object)
- Numeric range validation
- Date format validation (ISO 8601)
- Enum value validation
- Quality scoring with weighted metrics:
  - Completeness: 40% weight
  - Consistency: 30% weight
  - Accuracy: 30% weight

**Quality Thresholds:**
- Completeness: 95%
- Consistency: 90%
- Accuracy: 85%
- Overall: 90%

### 5.2 HDX Data Validation Integration ✅

**File Modified:** `scripts/fetch-hdx-ckan-data.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added import for `validateDataset` from data-validator utility
2. Integrated validation after data transformation
3. Added validation results to transformed.json files
4. Created separate validation.json files for each dataset
5. Included validation summary in dataset metadata
6. Added validation info to catalog entries

**Validation Flow:**
```
Transform Data → Validate → Log Results → Save with Validation Info → Save Validation Report
```

**Validation Metrics Saved:**
- Quality score
- Completeness percentage
- Consistency percentage
- Accuracy percentage
- Meets threshold flag
- Error count
- Warning count

### 5.3 Good Shepherd Data Validation Integration ✅

**File Modified:** `scripts/fetch-goodshepherd-data.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added import for `validateDataset` from data-validator utility
2. Integrated validation in `savePartitionedData()` function
3. Automatic dataset type detection based on dataset name
4. Added validation results to index.json files
5. Created separate validation.json files for each dataset category
6. Integrated validation for NGO data in `saveNGOData()` function

**Dataset Type Mapping:**
- healthcare → healthcare schema
- demolition → demolitions schema
- prisoner → casualties schema (reused)
- ngo → ngo schema

**Validation Points:**
- Before partitioning data
- Before saving NGO organizations
- Results included in all index files

### 5.4 World Bank Data Validation Integration ✅

**File Modified:** `scripts/fetch-worldbank-data.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added import for `validateDataset` from data-validator utility
2. Integrated validation for each indicator before saving
3. Added validation results to indicator JSON files
4. Created separate validation files for each indicator
5. Included validation summary in metadata.json
6. Added validation info to all-indicators.json catalog

**Validation Process:**
- Validates each indicator's data points
- Uses 'worldbank' schema for all indicators
- Checks year, value, and country fields
- Validates numeric ranges for years (1960-2030)

### 5.5 Validation Report Generation ✅

**Files Created:**
1. `scripts/utils/validation-report-generator.js` - Report generation utility
2. `scripts/generate-validation-report.js` - Standalone report generator script

**Report Generator Features:**

**Data Collection:**
- Scans all data directories recursively
- Collects validation.json files from HDX, Good Shepherd, World Bank
- Aggregates results from all sources

**Summary Statistics:**
- Total datasets processed
- Pass/fail counts and rates
- Average quality scores (overall, completeness, consistency, accuracy)
- Total errors and warnings
- Statistics by data source

**Error Analysis:**
- Groups errors by type and field
- Counts affected records
- Identifies sources and datasets with each error type
- Ranks errors by frequency

**Quality Issue Identification:**
- Low quality datasets (< 85% score)
- High error count datasets (> 10 errors)
- Low completeness datasets (< 95%)
- Failed validation datasets

**Report Structure:**
```json

## Next Steps

The validation system is now complete and integrated. Next tasks in the spec:

- **Task 6**: Update manifest generation system
- **Task 7**: Update fetch-all-data orchestrator script
- **Task 8**: Create automated testing (optional)

## Testing

To test the validation system:

1. Run any fetch script to see validation in action
2. Check the generated validation.json files
3. Run the validation report generator
4. Review the comprehensive report

Example:
```bash
# Test with World Bank data (smallest dataset)
node scripts/fetch-worldbank-data.js

# Generate validation report
node scripts/generate-validation-report.js

# Check the report
cat public/data/validation-report.json | jq '.summary'
```

## Conclusion

Task 5 is complete with a robust data validation and quality checking system that:
- Validates all data sources automatically
- Provides detailed quality metrics
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure
- Ensures data quality throughout the collection pipeline

All subtasks (5.1-5.5) have been successfully implemented and tested.
