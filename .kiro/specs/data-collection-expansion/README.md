# Data Collection Expansion Spec

## Overview

This spec implements **Phase 3** of the Complete Data Integration Roadmap: expanding local data collection to include 30-40 additional HDX datasets, completing Good Shepherd data categories, and expanding World Bank economic indicators.

## Status

✅ **Requirements**: Complete  
✅ **Design**: Complete  
✅ **Tasks**: Complete  
⏳ **Implementation**: Ready to start

## Quick Summary

### What This Spec Delivers

1. **30-40 HDX Datasets** across 6 categories:
   - Conflict/ACLED events (10+ datasets)
   - Education facilities (5+ datasets)
   - Water & sanitation (3+ datasets)
   - Infrastructure damage (5+ datasets)
   - Refugees & displacement (3+ datasets)
   - Humanitarian needs (5+ datasets)

2. **Complete Good Shepherd Data**:
   - Healthcare attacks (~2,900 records)
   - NGO financial data (177 orgs, $2.1B)
   - Demolitions data (~1,000 records)
   - All with quarter-based partitioning

3. **Expanded World Bank Indicators**:
   - From 40 to 60+ indicators
   - Additional poverty, trade, infrastructure, social indicators

4. **Enhanced Infrastructure**:
   - Robust error handling with retry logic
   - Data validation and quality scoring
   - Comprehensive manifest system
   - Automated orchestration

## Files

- `requirements.md` - 8 requirements with EARS-compliant acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Comprehensive architecture and component design
- `tasks.md` - 7 core tasks + 1 optional testing task (45 total sub-tasks)
- `README.md` - This file

## How to Execute

### Start Implementation

To begin implementing this spec, open `tasks.md` and click "Start task" next to Task 1.

### Recommended Order

1. **Task 1**: HDX expansion (highest priority, most datasets)
2. **Task 2**: Good Shepherd completion (high priority, fills gaps)
3. **Task 4**: Error handling (do this before Task 3 for reliability)
4. **Task 3**: World Bank expansion (straightforward, low risk)
5. **Task 5**: Validation (ensure quality)
6. **Task 6**: Manifests (make data discoverable)
7. **Task 7**: Orchestrator (tie it all together)
8. **Task 8**: Testing (optional, but recommended later)

### Estimated Time

- **Core Implementation** (Tasks 1-7): 12-16 hours
- **Optional Testing** (Task 8): 4-6 hours
- **Total**: 16-22 hours

## Success Criteria

### Data Collection
- ✅ 30-40 HDX datasets downloaded
- ✅ All Good Shepherd categories complete
- ✅ 60+ World Bank indicators available
- ✅ All data properly partitioned

### Data Quality
- ✅ Validation pass rate > 95%
- ✅ Data completeness > 95%
- ✅ No critical validation errors
- ✅ All manifests accurate

### Performance
- ✅ Total collection time < 20 minutes
- ✅ No memory issues
- ✅ Efficient storage usage
- ✅ Reliable error recovery

## Related Specs

- **real-data-integration**: Phase 1-2 (completed) - Local-first loading, frontend integration
- **modern-dashboard-redesign**: Dashboard UI improvements

## Next Steps After Completion

After completing this spec, you'll be ready for:

- **Phase 4**: Automation & Future-Proofing (GitHub Actions, versioning, monitoring)
- **Phase 5**: New Features (Healthcare dashboard, NGO tracker, Economic dashboard, Displacement dashboard)

## Notes

- Testing tasks (Task 8) are marked as optional to focus on core functionality first
- All fetch scripts include comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Data validation ensures quality without blocking downloads
- Manifest system makes all data discoverable by the frontend
