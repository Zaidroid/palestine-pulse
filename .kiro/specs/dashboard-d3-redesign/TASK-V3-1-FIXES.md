# Task 1 Fixes - Final Round

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Animation Restart on Hover ✅
**Problem**: Chart animations were restarting every time the mouse moved over the chart

**Root Cause**: The `animated` prop was being evaluated on every render, causing D3 to re-apply animations

**Solution**:
- Added `hasAnimatedRef` to track if animations have already been played
- Modified animation logic to only run on first render: `if (animated && !hasAnimatedRef.current)`
- Set `hasAnimatedRef.current = true` after first animation completes
- This ensures animations play once on mount, then never again during hover interactions

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/charts/demo/AnimatedAreaChart.tsx`

### 2. Demographic Breakdown Scale and Layout ✅
**Problem**: Donut chart wasn't using available space effectively, center text still had potential overlap

**Solution**:
- Increased outer radius from 0.75 to 0.85 (bigger donut)
- Decreased inner radius from 0.50 to 0.45 (more space for center text)
- Reduced pad angle from 0.03 to 0.02 (segments closer together)
- Increased corner radius from 6 to 8 (smoother, more modern look)
- Chart now fills more of the available 400px height

**Visual Impact**:
- Donut is significantly larger and more prominent
- Better use of widget space
- Center text has more breathing room
- More modern, polished appearance

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/v3/gaza/HumanitarianCrisis.tsx`

### 3. Daily New Casualties Tooltip Enhancement ✅
**Problem**: Tooltip only showed generic "Value:" label, didn't explain the data breakdown

**Solution**:
- Changed main label from "Value:" to "Total Casualties:"
- Added detailed breakdown in tooltip showing:
  - **Killed**: Shows count and percentage in red (destructive color)
  - **Injured**: Shows count and percentage in orange (warning color)
  - **Age Range**: Shows age range for age group charts
- Metadata is now displayed in a bordered section below the main value
- Color-coded values match the severity (killed = red, injured = orange)

**Example Tooltip Content**:
```
Dec 15
Total Casualties: 450

Killed: 180 (40.0%)
Injured: 270 (60.0%)
```

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/charts/d3/InteractiveBarChart.tsx`

## Technical Details

### Animation Fix Implementation
```typescript
// Added ref to track animation state
const hasAnimatedRef = useRef<boolean>(false);

// Modified animation logic
if (animated && !hasAnimatedRef.current) {
  // ... animation code ...
  hasAnimatedRef.current = true;
}
```

### Donut Chart Configuration
```typescript
innerRadiusRatio={0.45}  // Was 0.50
outerRadiusRatio={0.85}  // Was 0.75
padAngle={0.02}          // Was 0.03
cornerRadius={8}         // Was 6
```

### Tooltip Enhancement
```typescript
// Main label
<span>Total Casualties:</span>

// Metadata breakdown
{metadata.killed && (
  <div>Killed: {killed} ({killedPercentage}%)</div>
)}
{metadata.injured && (
  <div>Injured: {injured} ({injuredPercentage}%)</div>
)}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] AnimatedAreaChart: Hover over chart - animations should NOT restart
- [x] AnimatedAreaChart: Refresh page - animations should play once on load
- [x] Demographic Breakdown: Donut should be larger and fill more space
- [x] Demographic Breakdown: Center text should not overlap with donut
- [x] Daily New Casualties: Hover tooltip should show "Total Casualties:" not "Value:"
- [x] Daily New Casualties: Tooltip should show killed/injured breakdown
- [x] Age Group Chart: Tooltip should show age range in metadata
- [x] All charts: Should have consistent 450px container height

## Performance Impact

- **Animation Fix**: Significantly improved performance by preventing constant re-renders
- **Throttling**: Mouse move events throttled to 50ms (20fps) prevents excessive updates
- **Tooltip**: Minimal impact, only renders when visible

## Visual Consistency

All charts now have:
- 450px container height
- 400px chart content height
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Informative tooltips with context-specific labels
- Smooth, one-time animations on load
- No flickering or constant re-rendering

   - Implemented one-time animation logic
   - Improved tooltip label

2. `src/components/v3/gaza/HumanitarianCrisis.tsx`
   - Adjusted donut chart sizing
   - Maintained consistent heights

3. `src/components/charts/d3/InteractiveBarChart.tsx`
   - Enhanced tooltip with detailed breakdown
   - Added color-coded metadata display
   - Changed generic labels to specific ones
