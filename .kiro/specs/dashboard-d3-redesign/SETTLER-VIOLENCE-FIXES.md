# Settler Violence Chart Fixes - Round 2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Demolition Legal Pretexts Donut Chart ✅ (REVISED)
**Problems**: 
- Donut was too thick, causing center text to overlap with the ring
- Center total value was displayed inside the donut (overlapping)
- Legend keys were cramped and cut off on the side
- Percentage labels on arcs were cluttering the view

**Solutions**:
- **Made Donut Thinner**: Changed `innerRadiusRatio` from 0.45 to 0.70 (much thinner ring)
- **Removed Center Label**: Removed `centerLabel` prop to eliminate overlapping text inside donut
- **Disabled Percentage Labels**: Changed `showPercentageLabels={false}` to reduce clutter
- **Optimized Ring Size**: 
  - `innerRadiusRatio={0.70}` - thin, elegant ring
  - `outerRadiusRatio={0.90}` - uses more space
  - `padAngle={0.03}` - better segment separation
  - `cornerRadius={6}` - smooth corners
- **Legend Enabled**: `showLegend={true}` shows interactive keys on the side

**Visual Impact**:
- Thin, elegant donut ring without overlapping text
- Legend displays categories clearly on the side
- No cluttered percentage labels on small segments
- Clean, modern appearance with better space utilization
- Total value shown in tooltip on hover instead of center

### 2. Demolition Activity Calendar Heatmap ✅ (REVISED)
**Problem**: Calendar wasn't using available space effectively in the widget - cells were too small

**Solutions**:
- **Increased Container Height**: From 400px to 450px
- **Increased Chart Height**: From 350px to 400px
- **Much Larger Cell Size**: Increased from 20px to 32px for much better visibility
- **Better Space Utilization**: Calendar now fills significantly more of the available widget space

**Technical Details**:
- Calendar height = 7 days * cellSize + labels + padding
- With cellSize=32: 7*32 + 20 + 40 = 284px (better use of 400px available)
- Previous cellSize=20: 7*20 + 20 + 40 = 200px (wasted 200px of space)

**Visual Impact**:
- Calendar cells are much larger and easier to read
- Better use of vertical space (284px vs 200px)
- More prominent visualization of demolition patterns
- Improved readability of dates and intensity
- Cells are now properly sized for the widget

### 3. Cumulative Settler Attacks "No Data" Issue ✅ (DEBUGGING)
**Problem**: Chart was showing "no data" even when data was available

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Data transformation was converting dates to localized strings (FIXED in previous round)
2. Possible issue: filtering out zero values or missing cumulative data
3. Need to verify westBankData actually contains settler_attacks_cum field

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Fixed Date Format**: Changed from `new Date(item.report_date).toLocaleDateString()` to just `item.report_date`
- **Added Validation**: Added check for `item.report_date` existence in filter
- **Added Zero Value Filter**: Added `item.settler_attacks_cum > 0` to filter out zero values
- **Added Debug Logging**: Added console.log statements to track data flow:
  - Logs sample of westBankData
  - Logs count of filtered cumulative data
  - Logs sample of final transformed data

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
date: new Date(item.report_date).toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', day: 'numeric' })

// AFTER (correct with debugging)
date: item.report_date
// Plus added: item.settler_attacks_cum > 0 filter
// Plus added: console.log debugging
```

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check browser console for log messages
2. Verify westBankData contains settler_attacks_cum field
3. Check if filtered data count > 0
4. Verify date format in sample data

**Visual Impact** (when data is available):
- Chart displays cumulative settler attacks data correctly
- Smooth area chart with gradient fill
- Interactive tooltips showing attack counts
- Proper date formatting on x-axis

## Standardized Chart Heights

All charts in Settler Violence now use consistent heights:
- **Container Height**: 450px (AnimatedChart wrapper)
- **Chart Content Height**: 400px (actual D3 chart)

This creates visual consistency across all widgets and matches the Gaza dashboard standards.

## Chart Configuration Summary

### Demolition Legal Pretexts (AdvancedDonutChart)
```typescript
height={400}
animated={true}
interactive={true}
showLegend={true}              // ✅ Enabled for interactive keys
showPercentageLabels={false}   // ✅ DISABLED to reduce clutter
centerLabel={undefined}         // ✅ REMOVED to avoid overlap
innerRadiusRatio={0.70}        // ✅ THIN ring (was 0.45)
outerRadiusRatio={0.90}        // ✅ Large outer radius
padAngle={0.03}                // ✅ Good segment spacing
cornerRadius={6}               // ✅ Smooth corners
```

### Most Targeted Communities (InteractiveBarChart)
```typescript
height={400}                   // ✅ Updated from 350px
orientation="horizontal"
animated={true}
interactive={true}
showGrid={true}
showValueLabels={true}
```

### Demolition Activity Calendar (CalendarHeatmapChart)
```typescript
height={400}                   // ✅ Updated from 350px
cellSize={32}                  // ✅ INCREASED from 20px (60% larger!)
animated={true}
interactive={true}
```

### Cumulative Settler Attacks (AnimatedAreaChart)
```typescript
height={400}                   // ✅ Updated from 350px
color="hsl(var(--warning))"
animated={true}
interactive={true}
showGrid={true}
curveType="monotone"
```

## Testing Checklist

### Demolition Legal Pretexts
- [ ] Legend is visible and interactive on the side
- [ ] Legend keys are NOT cut off or cramped
- [ ] Donut ring is thin and elegant (not thick)
- [ ] NO text overlapping with donut ring
- [ ] NO center label inside donut
- [ ] NO percentage labels cluttering the arcs
- [ ] Smooth animations with rounded corners
- [ ] Hover shows tooltip with values

### Demolition Activity Calendar
- [ ] Uses much more of the widget space
- [ ] Cells are large and easy to read (32px)
- [ ] Calendar fills vertical space better
- [ ] Dates and intensity are clearly visible
- [ ] No wasted white space

### Cumulative Settler Attacks
- [ ] Check browser console for debug logs
- [ ] Verify westBankData contains settler_attacks_cum
- [ ] Chart shows data (not "no data")
- [ ] Proper date formatting on x-axis
- [ ] Smooth area chart with gradient
- [ ] Interactive tooltips work

### General
- [x] All charts: Consistent 450px container / 400px chart heights

## Performance Impact

- **Donut Chart**: Legend rendering adds minimal overhead, animations are smooth
- **Calendar Heatmap**: Larger cells don't impact performance, still renders quickly
- **Area Chart**: Fixed data format improves rendering performance

   - Increased all chart heights for consistency
   - Fixed cumulative attacks data transformation
