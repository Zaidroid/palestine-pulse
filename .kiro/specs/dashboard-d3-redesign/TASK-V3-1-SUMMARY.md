# Task 1 Summary: Replace Humanitarian Crisis Charts

## Completed: ✅ (with fixes applied)

### File Modified
- `src/components/v3/gaza/HumanitarianCrisis.tsx`

### Changes Made

#### 1.1 Replaced AreaChart with AnimatedAreaChart (D3) ✅
**What was changed:**
- Removed Recharts `AreaChart` component
- Added D3 `AnimatedAreaChart` component
- Transformed data to use Date objects instead of formatted strings
- Added metadata field to track anomalies
- Maintained anomaly detection logic

**Data transformation:**
```typescript
// Before: { date: string, value: number, anomalyValue?: number }
// After: { date: Date, value: number, metadata: { isAnomaly: boolean } }
```

**Benefits:**
- Smooth D3 animations with cubic easing
- Better performance with canvas-based rendering
- Interactive tooltips with hover effects
- Theme-aware colors
- RTL support built-in

#### 1.2 Replaced PieChart with AdvancedDonutChart (D3) ✅
**What was changed:**
- Removed Recharts `PieChart` and `Pie` components
- Added D3 `AdvancedDonutChart` component
- Transformed demographic data to CategoryData format
- Added center label showing total casualties
- Maintained color coding for different demographics

**Data transformation:**
```typescript
// Before: { name: string, value: number, color: string }
// After: { category: string, value: number, color: string }
```

**Benefits:**
- Animated arc transitions with hover expansion
- Center statistics display (total casualties)
- Interactive legend
- Percentage labels on arcs
- Better accessibility with ARIA labels

#### 1.3 Replaced BarCharts with InteractiveBarChart (D3) ✅
**What was changed:**
- Removed Recharts `BarChart` and `Bar` components
- Added D3 `InteractiveBarChart` component
- Replaced two bar charts:
  1. Casualties by Age Group (simple bars)
  2. Daily New Casualties (converted from stacked to grouped)

**Data transformation:**
```typescript
// Age Group Chart
// Before: { group: string, value: number }
// After: { category: string, value: number }

// Daily New Casualties Chart
// Before: { date: string, killed: number, injured: number }
// After: Flattened to separate bars for killed and injured
```

**Benefits:**
- Smooth bar animations with D3 transitions
- Hover effects with visual feedback
- Click handlers for potential drill-down
- RTL layout support
- Better color customization

### Imports Changed
**Removed:**
```typescript
import { AreaChart, Area, BarChart, Bar, PieChart, Pie, Cell, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from "recharts";
```

**Added:**
```typescript
import { AnimatedAreaChart } from "@/components/charts/demo/AnimatedAreaChart";
import { AdvancedDonutChart } from "@/components/charts/d3/AdvancedDonutChart";
import { InteractiveBarChart } from "@/components/charts/d3/InteractiveBarChart";
```

### Data Fetching Logic
✅ **No changes made** - All existing data fetching, filtering, and transformation logic remains intact
✅ **Same hooks used** - `useFilteredData`, `useV3Store`, etc. unchanged
✅ **Same calculations** - All metric calculations preserved

### Visual Improvements
1. **Animations**: All charts now have smooth D3 animations
2. **Interactivity**: Enhanced hover effects and tooltips
3. **Theme Support**: Better dark/light mode integration
4. **RTL Support**: Built-in support for Arabic layout
5. **Accessibility**: Improved ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Testing Notes
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
- ⏳ Visual testing needed to verify chart rendering
- ⏳ Test with real data to ensure proper display
- ⏳ Test RTL layout in Arabic
- ⏳ Test responsive behavior on mobile

### Next Steps
- Move to Task 2: Replace Infrastructure Destruction Charts
- Test the changes with the development server
- Verify animations work smoothly
- Check responsive behavior

### Known Limitations
1. **Daily New Casualties Chart**: Converted from stacked bars to grouped bars (side by side) because InteractiveBarChart doesn't support stacking. This may make the chart wider and harder to read with 30 days of data.
   - **Potential solution**: Consider using a different time range or creating a stacked bar variant

2. **Anomaly Detection**: The AnimatedAreaChart doesn't have built-in support for dual-series (normal + anomaly overlay). Anomalies are tracked in metadata but not visually highlighted yet.
   - **Potential solution**: Add custom rendering for anomaly points or use a different visualization approach

### Fixes Applied (Round 2)

#### Issue 1: AnimatedAreaChart Constant Refreshing
**Problem**: Chart was re-rendering on every mouse move, causing performance issues
**Solution**: 
- Added throttling to mousemove events (50ms delay = 20fps max)
- Used `useRef` for callbacks to prevent them from being in useEffect dependencies
- Added `lastUpdateRef` to track last update time

#### Issue 2: Demographic Breakdown Overlapping
**Problem**: Center text (total casualties) was overlapping with the donut chart
**Solution**:
- Increased chart height from 350px to 400px
- Increased container height from 400px to 450px
- Adjusted inner radius ratio from 0.65 to 0.50 for more space
- Adjusted outer radius ratio from 0.85 to 0.75
- Changed center label from "Total Casualties" to "Total" (shorter)

#### Issue 3: Tooltip Labels Not Descriptive
**Problem**: Tooltips showed generic "Value:" label instead of meaningful context
**Solution**:
- Changed AnimatedAreaChart tooltip from "Value:" to "Daily Casualties:"
- Added translation key support for better i18n

#### Issue 4: Inconsistent Chart Heights
**Problem**: Charts had different heights causing visual inconsistency
**Solution**:
- Standardized all charts to 450px container height
- Standardized all chart content to 400px height
- This creates uniform visual appearance across all widgets

### Chart Heights (Final)
- Daily Casualties: 450px container / 400px chart
- Demographic Breakdown: 450px container / 400px chart
- Casualties by Age Group: 450px container / 400px chart
- Daily New Casualties: 450px container / 400px chart
