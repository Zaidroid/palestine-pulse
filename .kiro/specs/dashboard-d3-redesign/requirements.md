# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive dashboard redesign that leverages the locally-stored data infrastructure and modern D3.js visualizations. The project will transform all dashboard sub-tabs with interactive, animated charts from the D3 library demo, implement complete Arabic localization with RTL support, and ensure accurate data source attribution throughout the application.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard**: The main application interface displaying humanitarian data visualizations
- **Sub-tab**: Individual sections within Gaza and West Bank tabs (e.g., Healthcare, Education, Economic)
- **D3.js**: Data-Driven Documents JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations
- **RTL**: Right-to-Left text direction for Arabic language support
- **Data Source Badge**: UI component displaying the origin, reliability, and metadata of displayed data
- **Local Data**: JSON files stored in `/public/data/` directory fetched by automated scripts
- **Filter Controls**: Time-based and category-based data filtering UI components
- **Chart Type**: Specific visualization pattern (e.g., Area Chart, Sankey Diagram, Calendar Heatmap)
- **Metadata**: Information about data including source, last update time, record count, and reliability
- **Localization Key**: Translation identifier in i18n JSON files
- **Interactive Demo**: Reference implementation at `src/components/charts/AdvancedInteractiveDemo.tsx`
