# Real Data Integration Requirements

## Introduction

The Palestine Pulse dashboard has a critical data authenticity problem: despite having a sophisticated data infrastructure with multiple verified sources (Tech4Palestine, Good Shepherd Collective, World Bank, HDX, WFP, B'Tselem), the Gaza and West Bank dashboard components are displaying hardcoded/fake data instead of leveraging this real data. This undermines the dashboard's credibility and defeats its humanitarian purpose. This feature will systematically audit, verify, and replace all fake data with authenticated real-time data from verified sources.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard_System**: The Palestine Pulse V3 dashboard application
- **Data_Consolidation_Service**: The V3 service that aggregates data from multiple sources
- **Verified_Data_Sources**: Authenticated APIs including Tech4Palestine, Good Shepherd Collective, World Bank, HDX, WFP, B'Tselem, and OCHA
- **Fake_Data**: Any hardcoded, mock, placeholder, or artificially generated data currently displayed in components
- **Data_Authenticity_Audit**: The process of identifying and cataloging all fake data instances
- **Real_Data_Pipeline**: The end-to-end flow from data source APIs to dashboard display
- **Data_Source_Verification**: The process of confirming data comes from legitimate, working APIs
- **Component_Data_Binding**: The technical connection between dashboard components and real data sources

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to conduct a comprehensive audit of all fake data in the dashboard, so that I can identify every instance that needs to be replaced with real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL identify all hardcoded values in Gaza dashboard components
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL identify all hardcoded values in West Bank dashboard components
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL catalog all mock data generation functions
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL document all placeholder calculations currently in use
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL create a comprehensive inventory of fake data instances with their locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify and test all existing data source APIs, so that I can confirm which sources are working and what data they provide.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL test connectivity to all Verified_Data_Sources
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL validate the data format and structure from each API
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL document the actual data available from each source
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL identify any gaps between required data and available data
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL establish baseline data quality metrics for each source

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a comprehensive mapping between dashboard components and real data sources, so that I can systematically replace fake data with authentic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL map each Gaza component metric to its corresponding Verified_Data_Sources
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL map each West Bank component metric to its corresponding Verified_Data_Sources
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL identify metrics that require data transformation or aggregation
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL document the data flow from API to component for each metric
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL prioritize data replacements based on component importance and data availability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing Gaza humanitarian data, I want to see authentic casualty and crisis information from verified sources, so that I can understand the real scope of the humanitarian crisis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL replace all fake Gaza casualty numbers with real data from Tech4Palestine API
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL display authentic demographic breakdowns from verified sources
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL show real press casualty data from Tech4Palestine press dataset
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL calculate infrastructure damage metrics from Good Shepherd Collective data
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL present real displacement and aid data from UN OCHA and WFP sources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing West Bank occupation data, I want to see authentic violence, settlement, and economic data from verified sources, so that I can understand the real impact of the occupation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL replace all fake West Bank violence statistics with real data from Good Shepherd Collective
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL display authentic home demolition data from Good Shepherd and B'Tselem sources
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL show real political prisoner statistics from Good Shepherd datasets
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL present authentic economic strangulation metrics from World Bank API
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL display real settlement expansion and land seizure data from verified sources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to automatically fetch and display the most recent data from all sources, so that I always see current information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL implement automatic data refresh mechanisms for all Verified_Data_Sources
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL handle API rate limits and failures gracefully without breaking the user experience
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL provide visual loading states during data fetching operations
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL cache data intelligently to balance freshness with performance
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL allow users to manually trigger data refresh when needed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear transparency about data sources and quality, so that I can assess the credibility and reliability of the information presented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL display clear data source attribution for every metric and chart
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL show data freshness indicators including last update timestamps
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL provide data quality badges indicating reliability levels
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL warn users when data sources are unavailable or stale
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL include links to original data sources where possible for verification

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify that no fake data remains in the system, so that I can ensure complete data authenticity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard_System SHALL provide automated tests that detect any remaining hardcoded values
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL validate that all displayed metrics come from Real_Data_Pipeline
3. THE Dashboard_System SHALL include integration tests that verify end-to-end data flow
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL implement monitoring that alerts when components fall back to fake data
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL provide a data authenticity report showing the source of every displayed value
