**Use this report to:** Understand how data flows from sources to components.

## How to Generate Reports

Run the audit script:

\`\`\`bash
npx tsx src/scripts/runDataAudit.ts
\`\`\`

This will:
1. Scan all dashboard components for fake data
2. Test connectivity to all data sources
3. Generate component-to-source mappings
4. Create comprehensive reports
5. Generate a prioritized replacement plan

## Report Interpretation

### Severity Levels

- **Critical:** Component has extensive fake data, high visibility, or blocks other work
- **High:** Significant fake data that impacts user trust
- **Medium:** Some fake data but has workarounds
- **Low:** Minor issues or low-priority components

### Implementation Status

- **fake:** Metric uses completely fake/hardcoded data
- **real:** Metric uses real data from verified sources
- **mixed:** Metric uses real data with fake fallbacks
- **partial:** Metric uses some real data but needs improvement

### Priority Scores

Priority scores range from 1-10:
- **9-10:** Critical, implement immediately
- **7-8:** High priority, implement in phase 1-2
- **5-6:** Medium priority, implement in phase 3
- **1-4:** Low priority, implement in phase 4 or later

## Next Steps

1. **Review AUDIT_SUMMARY.md** to understand the current state
2. **Check data-source-verification-report.json** to ensure all sources are working
3. **Follow REPLACEMENT_PLAN.md** for implementation
4. **Use component-audit-report.json** for detailed component fixes
5. **Refer to component-data-mapping.json** for data flow understanding

## Continuous Monitoring

After implementing fixes:

1. Re-run the audit script regularly
2. Monitor data source health
3. Track fake data regression
4. Update reports as needed
