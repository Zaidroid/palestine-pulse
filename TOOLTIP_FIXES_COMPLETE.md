# Tooltip & Click Event Fixes Complete ✨

Fixed two critical issues with the help tooltips and stat card interactions.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Z-Index Issue - Tooltips Getting Overlapped ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Help tooltips (question marks) were appearing behind chart elements (like the red circular chart in the screenshot).

**Root Cause**: Charts and other components create their own stacking contexts, making simple z-index values ineffective.

**Solution**: Used Radix UI's Portal feature to render tooltips outside the DOM hierarchy:

1. **Wrapped TooltipContent in Portal** - Renders tooltip at document root
2. **Wrapped HoverCardContent in Portal** - Renders hover cards at document root  
3. **Set z-index to 9999** - Ensures tooltips are always on top

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` - Added `TooltipPrimitive.Portal` wrapper
- `src/components/ui/hover-card.tsx` - Added `HoverCardPrimitive.Portal` wrapper
- Removed redundant z-index classes from individual components

**Technical Details**:
```tsx
// Before (didn't work)
<TooltipContent className="z-[100]">

// After (works perfectly)
<TooltipPrimitive.Portal>
  <TooltipContent className="z-[9999]">
</TooltipPrimitive.Portal>
```

**Result**: All help tooltips now render at the document root level and appear on top of ALL elements, including charts, graphs, and any other components regardless of their stacking context.

### 2. Click Event Bubbling - Multiple Modals Opening
**Problem**: Clicking on source badges or help icons in stat cards would trigger both:
1. The badge/tooltip action
2. The card's expanded view modal

**Solution**: Added proper event handling to prevent click propagation:

1. **Footer section** - Wrapped in div with `stopPropagation` and `preventDefault`
2. **Source badge** - Additional wrapper with event stopping
3. **Quality warning** - Additional wrapper with event stopping
4. **Metric tooltip** - Wrapped in div with event stopping

**Code Pattern Used**:
```tsx
<div 
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.preventDefault();
  }}
>
  {/* Interactive element */}
</div>
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/enhanced-metric-card.tsx`

**Result**: 
- Clicking on source badges only opens the source info
- Clicking on help icons only shows the tooltip
- Clicking on the card itself opens the expanded view
- No more multiple modals opening simultaneously

## Technical Details

### Z-Index Hierarchy
```
z-[100] - Tooltips and help content (highest)
z-50    - Modals and dialogs
z-40    - Dropdowns and popovers
z-30    - Fixed headers/footers
z-20    - Overlays
z-10    - Elevated cards
z-0     - Base content
```

### Event Handling
- Used both `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()` for maximum compatibility
- Applied to parent containers to catch all child events
- Maintained accessibility by keeping proper button/link semantics

### Components Affected
1. **EnhancedMetricCard** - Main stat card component
2. **DataEducationTooltip** - Educational help tooltips
3. **MetricTooltip** - Metric definition tooltips
4. **DataQualityWarning** - Quality indicator tooltips

### 3. Data Source Modal in Expanded View ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When clicking on data source badges in the expanded modal, both the data source hover card AND the expanded modal were visible simultaneously.

**Solution**: Added `disableHoverCard` prop to `EnhancedDataSourceBadge`:

1. **New prop** - `disableHoverCard?: boolean` to control hover card behavior
2. **Conditional rendering** - When disabled, renders badge without HoverCard wrapper
3. **Applied in modal** - Set `disableHoverCard={true}` in expanded modal's data sources section

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/v3/shared/EnhancedDataSourceBadge.tsx` - Added prop and conditional logic
- `src/components/ui/enhanced-metric-card.tsx` - Applied prop in expanded modal

**Result**: In the expanded modal, data source badges are displayed but don't trigger the hover card, preventing multiple overlapping modals.

## Testing Checklist

✅ Help icons (question marks) appear above charts
✅ Help icons appear above other cards
✅ Clicking source badge doesn't open card modal
✅ Clicking help icon doesn't open card modal
✅ Clicking quality warning doesn't open card modal
✅ Clicking card body still opens expanded view
✅ All tooltips are readable and not cut off
✅ Tooltips work on mobile devices
✅ Data source badges in expanded modal don't trigger hover cards
✅ Only one modal visible at a time

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Better Visibility**: Help tooltips are always visible, never hidden behind other elements
2. **Precise Interactions**: Each clickable element does exactly what it should
3. **No Confusion**: Users won't accidentally trigger multiple actions
4. **Smooth Experience**: Interactions feel natural and predictable
